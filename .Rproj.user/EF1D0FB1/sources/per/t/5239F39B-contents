Title: Wrapper function parlMICE
Description: For big datasets or high number of imputations, performing multiple imputation with 
  function mice from package mice (Van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) might take a long time.
  As a solution, wrapper function parlMICE was created to enable the imputation procedure to be run 
  in parallel. This is done by dividing the imputations over multiple cores (or CPUs), thus potentially 
  speeding up the process.
